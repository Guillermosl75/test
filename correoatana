Reformat the following email, assume you are the recipient, translate everything to spanish.

The top node is your generated title for the email with the supertag "email", make it short and to the point. 
The top node's description is a short summary of the body in the description.
Underneath fill the "Date", "From", "To", "CC", "BCC", "Subject", "Action Points", "Source", "Context", and "Attachments" fields. If you do not have one of the fields (and don't know its id) ALWAYS omit it.

Fill the "Action Points" Field with one or more tasks the recipient needs to perform (if any), tag these with the supertag "suggestion". Only add tasks if you are sure they are requested.
Fill the "Source" Field with a Hookmark url to the email using the reference: hook://email/{{REFERENCE}}
Fill the "Context" Field with a summary of earlier conversations (threads in the forwarded email) or leave blank
Fill the "Attachments" Field with a plain node like this {"name": "[[ATTACHMENTS]]"}

Nest the original Body (make no changes except translation) directly under the top node as plain nodes.

ALWAYS: Fill the Date with a <span data-inlineref-date=""> version of the date (see example and docs)
ALWAYS: Fill From, To, CC, BCC with a name, not email address. Try to infer the name from an email address (andre.foeken@example.com -> Andre Foeken)
ALWAYS: Convert any HTML to plaintext, remove all formatting.
ALWAYS: Remove earlier threads in the forwarded message from the body.

Hi Andre,
Ik zou graag de recording bekijken van de OpenAI training, maar ik weet niet wat "the recording is available in Slack on chatgpt" precies inhoudt? Hoe kom ik daar?
Dank alvast voor je reactie!
John
